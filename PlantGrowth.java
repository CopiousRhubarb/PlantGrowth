// Purpose
// Lately I have been getting into growing plants from seed. This is a process that is very daunting, but rewarding. I want to see how different conditions would effect the growth of my plants, such as how much sunlight and water the plant recieves. 
// So this program will be used to simulate seedling growth under different conditions. 

// Collaborators: Ryan Moore and Caitlin Lim

public class PlantGrowth {
    public static void main(String[] args) {


//DECLARATION SECTION
    int week; 
    int sunlight; //full, partial, and shaded will be calculated separately
    int water; //top and bottom watered will be calculated in addition to sunlight

//INITIALIZATION SECTION

//INPUT + CALCULATION SECTION

//method 1: calculate growth under different sunlight conditions - Ryan

//method 2: calculate growth under different watering conditions - Caitlin

//mathod 3: drawing seed - Ryan

//method 4: introducing the user to the project - Caitlin
